# Dog Breed Classifer Project
![alt text](app_test_images/dog/dachshund-1519374_640.jpg)

### Summary
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In this project, I learnt how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

The project includes a Flask web app where a user can input a new image and get classification of human / dog / or an error if they are neither plus the closest resembling dog breed.

## Project setup

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
```	
git clone https://github.com/Duella12345/dog_project.git
cd dog-project
```

2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`. 

3. Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder. 

4. Download the [VGG-16 bottleneck features](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz) for the dog dataset.  Place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features`.

5. Download the [Resnet-50 bottleneck features](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogResnet50Data.npz) for the dog dataset.  Place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features`.

6. Open the notebook and run all to see the development process.
```
jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
```

7. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up model, this may take a few minutes to run.

    - To run the model training pipeline:
        
        `python train_model.py` (using defaults)

2. To run the app: go to `app` directory: `cd app`

3. Run the web app: `flask --app app.py run`

4. Visit 'http://127.0.0.1:5000' to open the homepage
